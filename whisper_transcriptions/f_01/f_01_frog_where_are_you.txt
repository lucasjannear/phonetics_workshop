There was a boy, a dog, and a frog, and the boy kept the frog in a jar in his room.
While the boy and the dog were sleeping, the frog got out of the jar, and when the boy
woke up, the frog was gone.
The boy and the dog looked around the room for the frog.
The boy looked out the window and called frog, where are you?
The dog looked in the jar and got his head stuck.
When he put his head out the window, he fell out.
The boy picked up the dog to check if he was okay.
The boy called out frog, where are you?
The dog was barking at a beehive.
The boy looked into a hole and said frog, where are you?
And a gopher popped out and bit his nose.
The beehive fell and the bee started chasing the dog.
And the boy looked in a hole in a tree.
He said frog, where are you?
And out flew an owl and the boy fell.
And the bees, who were angry, kept chasing the dog.
The boy climbed on top of a rock and held onto a branch and called out frog, where are you?
But it wasn't a branch.
The boy was holding onto antlers from a deer.
The deer picked up the boy and ran towards the edge of a cliff.
The deer stopped at the edge of the cliff and the boy and the dog fell off the cliff
into a pond.
They popped out of the pond and the boy listened.
They heard something.
The boy said, shh, was listening.
They looked over a log and they found two frogs and a bunch of baby frogs.
The boy picked one of the baby frogs and took it home with him.
They said goodbye frogs.
The end.
